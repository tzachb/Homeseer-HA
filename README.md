This PR adds the `tzachb/Homeseer-HA` integration to the HACS default list.

The repository follows the HACS structure:
- `hacs.json` is in the root
- `custom_components/homeseer/` includes `manifest.json`, integration files
- `.github/workflows/hacs.yaml` exists for validation


@hacs/integration-maintainers â€” the repo has been cleaned and validation workflow is fixed. Could you please approve the workflows so the checks can run? Thank you!
<!-- Triggering HACS validation -->
